/* Workflow for contact_book:
 *   1. There is a single global contacts book.
 *   2. A contact can be added to the contact book, creating a unique identifier
 *      for the contact in the contact book.
 *   3. The contact book can be queried for a contact based on it's unique
 *      identifier within the contact book.
 *   4. A contact can be labeled as a favorite contact within the contact book.
 *   5. A contact that was favorited can be unfavorited.
 *   6. A contact can be removed from the contact book by its unique id.
